#   Graph Data Structure
***
Graph is connction of nodes(vertices) and edges that connect pair of nodes.

## Terminology
1. __Vertex(node):__<br/>

2. __Edge:__ <br/>
This is a connection  between two vertices.
Edges can be one way(directed) or two way(undirected).

3. __Weight:__<br/>
This is the value associated with an edge, represents cos, distance between nodes.

4. __Degree:__<br/>
This is the number of edges in a vertex.

5. __Path__:<br/>
This is sequence of vertices connected by edges.

6. __Cycle__:<br/>
This is a path that starts and ends in same vertex.
