#   Graph Data Structure
***
Graph is connction of nodes(vertices) and edges that connect pair of nodes.

## Terminology
1. __Vertex(node):__<br/>

2. __Edge:__ <br/>
This is a connection  between two vertices.
Edges can be one way(directed) or two way(undirected).
    - __Directed graphs:__
This is a graph which edges have direction, represented by arrow pointing to nodes.
It is a unidirectional way i.e has only one way to traverse <br/>
i.e `a->b` is not same as `b->a`
    - __Undirected graph:__
This is a graph which the edges has no direction. It is bi-directional i.e can be tranversed from both nodes <br/>
i.e: `a-b` is same as `b-a`
3. __Weight:__<br/>
This is the value associated with an edge, represents cos, distance between nodes.

4. __Degree:__<br/>
This is the number of edges in a vertex.

5. __Path__:<br/>
This is sequence of vertices connected by edges.

6. __Cycle__:<br/>
This is a path that starts and ends in same vertex.
