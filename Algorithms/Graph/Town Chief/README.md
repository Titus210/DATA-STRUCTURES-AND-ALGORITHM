# Algorithm and Town Chief Identification

***
## Introduction
This project explores the concept of algorithms and how they can be used to identify the town chief in a fictional town. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a specific problem or performing a particular task. In this scenario, we are given a set of trust relationships between people in the town, and our goal is to find the town chief using a graph-based approach.
