# Tree Data Structure

***

## Introduction

Tree is a collection of objects/entries known a s nodes linked together to represent data.

- It is __non-linear__ data structure.

## Terms used

1. __Root__: This is the topmost node.
    - It has no parent.
    - Has height of 0 if empty.
2. __Child__: This is a descendant of any node.
3. __Parent__: This is a node with a subtree.
4. __Leaf node__: This is the bottom most node
    - Has no child.
    - Has the maximum height
    - Has a depth of (no of nodes - 1).
5. __Internal node__: This is node with atleast one child
6. __Ancestors__: This is any predecessor of a tree
7. __Descendant__: This is immediate sucessor of a node.

### QUICK FACTS

## Properties

1. __Recursive__:It implicts a recursive manner in which the tree redeces itself to similar manner i.e creates a subtree.
2. __Height of node__:
This is the longest path from root to node.
3. __Depth of node__: This is the no od edges from root to node.
