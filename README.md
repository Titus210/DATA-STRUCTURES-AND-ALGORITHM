#   Data Structures and Algorithm
***
## Introduction
Data structures is structural representation of logical relationships between elements of data. <br/>
It  can also be described as group of data elements which provide efficient way of sharing and organizing data in computer to be effectively used.
### Terminologies related to data structures
1. __Data__: This is elementary value or collection of values.
2. __Record__: Collection of various data items.
3. __File__: Collection of various records of one entity.
4. __Entity__: Is the class of certain object and attribute.
5. __Field__: Is a single elementary unit of information representing attribute of entity.

##  Need for data structures
1. Processor Speed
2. Data search
3. Multiple request

>    Data structure = organization + representation


## Programming Methodologies
This deals with different methods of designing programming. <br/>
Data is basic entity for calculation and manipulation progress, t can be single unit or set. <br/>
There are two types of data:
   - Numerical: float, integer
   - Alphabet: string
Representation of particular D.S id called __storage structure__.
Data structure should be represented in a way utilize maximum efficiency. <br/>
Storage structure represented in auxillary memory is called __file structure__ <br/>

To solve real life problem, we define the problem, then design the algorithm.

### Stepwise Refinement
This is when problem is refined(converted) stepwise to a program.

Approaches to algorithm design
1. Top-Down
2. Bottom-Up

### Stepwise Refinement technique
This is technique used in algorithm and data structure to design and develop a solution incrementally by breaking down problem to small sub problems and solving eah separated then building final solution gradually 
through series of intermediate stages.
#### Benefits
- Makes solution development problem manageable by dividing, conquer and combine.
- Makes solution understandable
- Makes easier to debug and refine solution as each stage is tested.
- Minimizes error and oversites as solution is developed incrementally.

### Modular Programming
This is procedural way of programming that focuses on writhing code as functions. <br/> It involves breaking down large complex programs to smaller, manageable modules/ components which 
perform single well defined function and minimal interactions.<br/>
Discourages use of control variables and falgs as paramerers which indicates caller function needs to know much about how functionis implemented.<br/>
Encourage splitting functions to two types:
1. Master: which controls program flow.
2. Slave: which handles low level detailed i.e moving data between structures.

#### Features of modular programming
1. __Abstraction__: Hide detailes expose essential features.
2. __Encapsulation__: internal implementation of internal data structures is holder from other modules making it flexibe preventing unintended interactions.
3. __Reusability__: reduce code 
4. __Separation of Concerns__
5. __Interfaces__: defines output, inputs and its operations.
6. __Cohesion__
7. __Couping__: Minimizes couping making program flexible.

We can implement using top-down and bottom-up.

### Top-Down Design

Top-down design is a structured approach to problem-solving and algorithm design. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems or modules. Each module is designed and implemented independently, and then they are integrated to form the complete solution.

**Key steps in top-down design:**

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Start by defining the main problem. Then, decompose it into smaller, logically related subproblems.

2. **Module Specification**: Define the interface and specifications for each module, including the inputs, outputs, and functionality.

3. **Independent Development**: Develop each module separately, without worrying about the internal details of other modules. This encourages code reusability.

4. **Integration**: Combine the individual modules to create the complete solution. Ensure that the modules work together seamlessly.

5. **Testing**: Test the entire system to verify that it behaves as expected. If any issues are identified, they can be traced back to specific modules for debugging.

### Bottom-Up Design

In contrast to top-down design, bottom-up design starts with the development of individual modules and gradually builds up to the complete system.

**Key steps in bottom-up design:**

1. **Develop Modules**: Begin by creating individual modules that perform specific tasks or functions.

2. **Integration**: Combine these modules to create larger modules or subsystems.

3. **Testing**: Test each module and subsystem independently to ensure they work correctly.

4. **Incremental Build**: Gradually build up the entire system by integrating larger modules until the complete solution is achieved.

Bottom-up design is often used when you have well-defined modules or components that can be developed independently and then integrated to form the final system.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a specific task. They are fundamental to computer science and are used in various applications.

Data structures, on the other hand, are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. They complement algorithms by providing the necessary data organization.

### Importance of Algorithms and Data Structures

Efficient algorithms and well-designed data structures are crucial for optimizing program performance. They can significantly impact factors such as processing speed, memory usage, and scalability.

## Common Data Structures

There are several common data structures used in computer science and programming. Some of the key data structures include:

1. **Arrays**: Ordered collections of elements accessed by an index or key.

2. **Linked Lists**: Linear data structures where elements are linked together in a sequence.

3. **Stacks**: A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

4. **Queues**: A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

5. **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures with a root element and child nodes.

6. **Graphs**: Collections of nodes connected by edges, allowing for complex relationships.

7. **Hash Tables**: Data structures that store key-value pairs for efficient retrieval.

Understanding these data structures and their characteristics is essential for choosing the right one for a specific problem and optimizing algorithms.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into each of these data structures and explore algorithms associated with them.
