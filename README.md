#   Data Structures and Algorithm
***
## Introduction
Data structures is structural representation of logical relationships between elements of data. <br/>
It  can also be described as group of data elements which provide efficient way of sharing and organizing data in computer to be effectively used.
### Terminologies related to data structures
1. __Data__: This is elementary value or collection of values.
2. __Record__: Collection of various data items.
3. __File__: Collection of various records of one entity.
4. __Entity__: Is the class of certain object and attribute.
5. __Field__: Is a single elementary unit of information representing attribute of entity.

##  Need for data structures
1. Processor Speed
2. Data search
3. Multiple request

>    Data structure = organization + representation


## Programming Methodologies
This deals with different methods of designing programming. <br/>
Data is basic entity for calculation and manipulation progress, t can be single unit or set. <br/>
There are two types of data:
   - Numerical: float, integer
   - Alphabet: string
Representation of particular D.S id called __storage structure__.
Data structure should be represented in a way utilize maximum efficiency. <br/>
Storage structure represented in auxillary memory is called __file structure__ <br/>
